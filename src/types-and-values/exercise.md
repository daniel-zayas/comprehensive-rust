# Exercise: Fibonacci

The Fibonacci sequence begins with `[0,1]`. For n>1, the n'th Fibonacci number
is calculated recursively as the sum of the n-1'th and n-2'th Fibonacci numbers.

Write a function `fib(n)` that calculates the n'th Fibonacci number. When will
this function panic?

```rust,editable,should_panic
{{#include exercise.rs:fib}}
    if n < 2 {
        // The base case.
        todo!("Implement this")
    } else {
        // The recursive case.
        todo!("Implement this")
    }
}

{{#include exercise.rs:main}}
```
## Additional exercices collective-rustlings

We will be using [`collective-rustlings`](https://codeberg.org/mo8it/collective-rustlings) for the additional exercises in this course.

> `collective-rustlings` is a temporary fork of [`rustlings`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings) which is a collection of "small exercises to get you used to reading and writing Rust code".
> `rustlings` is an awesome learning resource for Rust!
>
> I created the fork to be able to integrate [`collective-score`](https://codeberg.org/mo8it/collective-score) into it so that your progress is shared with the class while you work on the exercises.
> I also removed some exercises and changed the order of some to fit the order of topics in this course.

Before starting with the exercises, you have to follow the following steps:

- [Install Rust using `rustup`](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- [Install VS-Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (unless you want to use your own editor with language server support [`rust-analyzer`](https://rust-analyzer.github.io/))
  - [Install the `rust-analyzer` plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust-analyzer)
- Install Git if not already installed on your system.
- [Follow the instructions in the README](https://codeberg.org/mo8it/collective-rustlings/src/branch/main/README.md#getting-started) to **clone** the `collective-rustlings` repository, **install** the program, **register** yourself and **enable** the `rust-analyzer` support.
- Open the directory `collective-rustlings` of the cloned repository in VS-Code.
- Open a terminal in VS-Code and run the command `rustlings watch` in it.

If you need any help, you can always ask me ðŸ˜ƒ

You should do the following Rustlings:

- `intro1`
- `intro2`
- `variables1`
- `variables2`
- `variables3`
- `variables4`
- `variables5`


`rustlings watch` will guide you through these exercises in the same order.
But **you should stop after the last exercise listed above**.
The rest of the exercises will be done later.
